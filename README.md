# assembler
## Assembler project for course 20465
### Languages: C

"assembler" project is a C-written project which was written as a part of the course 20465 of the Open University.

The students were given a pseudolanguage (a more simple version of MIPS assembly) and were asked to build an assembler for the pseudolanguage.
The assembler passes through the "source file" (.as) twice, and writes an objects file (.ob), an entries file (.ent) and an externals file (.ext) for it.

The project shows a good understaing of the C-language and its advance utilites: pointers, types, dynamic memory allocation, unions etc.

**attached**: source files (.c, .h),
              makefile [^1], 
              running examples (in EXAMPLES folder).

[^1]: The project was written for 16.04 ubuntu VM.
